# eachDayOneReactEvent
Each day I am triyng to prepare some small react project-pages.

Screenshots or little videos that shows functionality of pages will be uploaded soon.

# Pages and apps respectively:
1-) Tour List: :world_map:

Basicly, I have used some custom hooks such as useState and useEffect. I have practiced JSX format and fetch.

2-) To-do List: :heavy_check_mark:

Basicly, I have designed a To-do list app with add,delete,complete,update buttons. I have used some custom hooks such as useState, useEffect.
I have practiced JSX, CSS. I have used conditional rendering and local storage.

3-) Review Page: :memo:

Basicly, I have designed a page which shows some reviews from data.js. I have used prev, next and random buttons to show reviews. 
I have used data destructing method and some custom hooks such as useState.

4-) BookStore Pages: :books:

Basicly I have designed couple of pages to show books as a list and a page for detailed information. I have practiced Dynamic-static Routing together.
I have practiced parameter passing and used some custom hooks such as useState, useEffect, useNavigate. I have listed books as cards on main page
and with a "show details" button on cards I have managed to navigate to details page and passed to parameters from the link.

5-) Accordion Page: :interrobang:

Basicly, I have designed a small FAQ page with accordion styling. There are 5 questions I took from data.js and I have made an accordion with conditional rendering.

6-) Menu Page:	:pizza:

Basicly, I have designed a menu page which has foods in different categories. I have added some tabs to filter the foods and rerender the menu. Apart from that, I have used dynamic approach while creating tabs. For instance, if you add a new food with different category to the data.js, my menu will dynamically creates that category tab and filters it.

7-) Elysium App: :shopping_cart:

This app is an ecommerce website project. I haven't added payment method yet. I have used Sanity for Backend works. I have used NextJS.

8-) Simba Portfolio: :bearded_person:

This is just a portfolio website. Seems cool to me. Probably I will deploy it soon.
